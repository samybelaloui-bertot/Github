Welcome to my Github. Here you can find some project that I developed during my studies. Some projects were made in team
and some projects were developed in french.



APIs script : 
I wanted to use the Google Machine Learning APIs (Vision, Natural & Translation) to build a sentence from a picture with 
a python script. I used this script at school on a Pepper robot, the input picture of the script was a photo taken by the 
camera of the robot. As a consequence the robot could try to speak in real time. To use this script you have to launch 
AI.py and put the name of a picture located in Vision/images/

Business creation project :
In 2016 I made a business creation project at school. We were simulating the creation of a startup called "NUTRICAPS" 
specialized in vegetable soup machines. My team finished at the 4th position out of 50 teams. You can find here the final 
report, the Gantt schedule and the business plan.


C language :
You can find a chess game developed in C language (actually that's a "Siam" game) in a linux environment. The first step is to make the project (cd src, make). Then you have to launch the executable (cd bin, sudo ./jeu_siam). You can see the sources in /src. Rules : "To win Siam, be the first player 
to push a rock off of the board. Either animal can push a rock, but if you want to push an animal facing you, you have to be 
superior in numbers, e.g., you will need two animals to push one or three to push two." (boardgamegeekk.com)

I put also a short program that I developped : a client-serveur communication system with pipelines. That can be used in multi-tasks projects. You will need 2 terminals.
Terminal 1 : gcc -o Serveur serveur.c then ./Serveur
Terminal 2 : gcc -o Client client.c then ./Client
Every time you launch the client command, a random calculation is made


Digital electronics :
The project "chronoscore" is a duration and score display, programmed on a FPGA. You will need Xilinx ISE Deisgn Tools to launch the project. 


Electrical engineering :
The goal of this project was to do a simplified simulation of the plane "Solar Impulse". We modelized the energy chain from solar panels to motors. As a consequence we used a chopper device, an ups and a transformation system. We made specific calculations. You will need LTSpice to launch this project. 


Robotics :
That's a surveillance robot built by 2 classmates and me. You can see the video (link in the text file) for more information. You can't launch the project because you don't have all the required devices but you can see the sources (bash script and the ROS packages).



Website :
This is a website about acupuncture, you can see it on a Windows environment with wamp (replace the www folder and go to localhost with your browser). The Smarty template was used to make the sources more readable. There is also a webservice developped (a calculator), for example you just need to go to http://localhost/addition/1/2 if you want to make an addition.
